# Cluster Files by File Type\n\nThis Bash script organizes files in a specified directory by clustering them into folders based on their file extensions.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Validation:** Checks if a folder path is provided and whether it is a valid directory.\n- **Automation:** Automatically creates folders for each unique file extension found.\n- **Organization:** Moves files into corresponding folders based on their file types.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. **Make the script executable** (if not already):\n\n   ```bash\n   chmod +x your_script.sh\n   ```\n\n2. **Run the script** with the path to the directory you want to organize:\n\n   ```bash\n   ./your_script.sh <folder_path>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<folder_path>` with the path to the target directory.\n\n## How It Works\n\n- **Input Validation:** The script first checks that exactly one argument (the folder path) is provided and that the path is a valid directory.\n- **Iteration:** It then iterates through each file in the directory.\n- **File Clustering:** For every file, the script extracts the file extension, creates a folder with that name if it doesnâ€™t exist, and moves the file into the respective folder.\n- **Completion Message:** Finally, it prints a message indicating that the files have been clustered.\n\n## Example\n\nAssume you have the following files in your directory:\n\n```\ndocument.txt\nimage.jpg\nscript.sh\n```\n\nAfter running the script:\n\n```bash\n./your_script.sh /path/to/your/directory\n```\n\nThe directory structure will be organized as follows:\n\n```\ntxt/document.txt\njpg/image.jpg\nsh/script.sh\n```\n\n## Requirements\n\n- A Unix-based system with Bash installed.\n- Basic permissions to create directories and move files in the specified directory.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is open source and available under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n## Author\n\nCreated by [Your Name]  \nFeel free to modify and improve this script as needed.
